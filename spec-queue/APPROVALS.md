# Approvals

The only file the FIX window (23:00-07:00) reads to learn what the operator said. Written by the
DECIDE session, not by hand and not by either scheduled window. Format and semantics: `README.md`
in this directory.

```
- APPROVED  <change-name>   optional note
- REVISING  <change-name>   what needs to change
- REJECTED  <change-name>   why
ORDER: <change-name>, <change-name>, F156      (optional, that night only)
NOTHING TONIGHT                                 (optional, stops the window)

Newest day first. Days below the newest are history and are not read.

## 2026-09-01

Review page: `review/review-2026-09-01.html`. One change proposed, taken through all three rounds.
Write its row below in the contract's form — the status token goes between the `-` and the change
name. Leaving the row out entirely is undecided, not rejection. **No real token is written here:**
the day window proposed this change and must not appear to have approved its own work, so the line
below is a blank to fill, not a row.

- APPROVED  runner-model-is-chosen-from-the-catalog   operator, 2026-09-01 17:40, in session
- APPROVED  a-turn-says-how-it-ended   operator, 2026-09-01 20:15, in session -- CONDITIONAL, see below

`a-turn-says-how-it-ended` -- F190 (A). Approved with a condition the operator stated when
approving: **observed first, and tested after implementation by a new round.** The contract here has
only three tokens and no way to say "approved with a precondition", so the condition is encoded as
blocking structure inside the change instead:

- **Phase 0 is a gate.** It says, in the tasks file itself: if phase 0 has not been completed and
  recorded, do phase 0 and stop. A window reaching this change with no observation record performs
  the six observations, writes them up, and ends its turn. Nothing is implemented.
- **Phase 7 is a separate round.** Implementation does not close the change and task 6.7 no longer
  retires F190; a sitting that did not write the code re-runs phase 0's observations against the
  built product and closes it.
- **Phase 0 can falsify the design.** Task 0.3 in particular: rounds 2 and 3 disagree about whether
  a single-run conversation is affected, and if the indicator releases cleanly there, the round 3b
  finding is wrong and the change returns to a round rather than proceeding.

Why the condition is right, in one line: four rounds of review each found the defect nearest the
code that sitting happened to read, three of them read the same gate expression, and none of them
checked where its inputs come from. Every claim in the change is derivation; none is observation.

Note also that `DECISIONS.md` **D-7 is OPEN** and groups response-shape changes as ones "no window
took unattended". This change is a BREAKING envelope. The phase 0 gate is what makes an unattended
window safe to let near it; D-7 itself is still undecided.

`runner-model-is-chosen-from-the-catalog` — F173 (A). The runner screen free-types the model against
a shipped requirement that says it must offer the catalog's, and swallows the backend's refusal
entirely. 29 tasks across the API, the picker, the error surface, tests and a drive; retires F173
(A), F219 (C) and F220 (C). Round 2 and round 3 each changed it — the argument in section 4 of the
review page.

If you approve nothing, the FIX window falls to the default queue and lands on open findings, A
first — which is F173 again, by the finding route and without this design. `ORDER:` and
`NOTHING TONIGHT` are both available.

Two decisions on the page are **not** work and want no row here: ratifying the `fastmcp<4` ceiling,
and leaving F188/F190 unproposed as direct repairs.

ORDER: a-turn-says-how-it-ended, runner-model-is-chosen-from-the-catalog

**Why this order.** `a-turn`'s phase 0 is a gate: it observes and stops, touching no product code,
so it cannot collide with anything and cannot run long. Putting it first spends perhaps an hour to
learn whether the design is *right* — task 0.3 can falsify it outright, since rounds 2 and 3
disagree about whether a single-run conversation is affected. Learning that tonight is worth more
than learning it after the change is built. `runner-model` then gets the rest of the window; it is
approved unconditionally, disjoint from everything else in flight, and is the item that actually
ships.

**Both touch `hub/ui/src`, and that is safe only because of the order.** `hub/hub/static/ui` is a
committed build artefact and two UI changes in flight conflict on it every time. Phase 0 writes no
UI, so there is exactly one UI change tonight.

`a-write-outside-the-workspace-is-recorded` has **no row** and is therefore undecided, not rejected
— it is R3-complete but never approved, and it collides with `a-turn` on three files. Do not build
it tonight. Before anyone does, fix its task 4.2: it names migration `0100`, and
`hub/hub/migrations/versions/0100_loop_work_needs_evidence.py` already exists, so it must be `0101`.

If the window finishes both, the next most valuable thing is **F188** — the last severity-A finding
with no change and no design (see `DECISIONS.md`, *Not decisions*). Spec it; do not repair it
directly.
