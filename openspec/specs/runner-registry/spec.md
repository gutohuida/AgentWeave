# runner-registry Specification

## Purpose

Define project-scoped, Hub-owned runner records that separate reusable execution capability from
agent identity and provide explicit, operator-managed agent bindings.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Runners are project-scoped Hub records

The Hub SHALL persist runner definitions as project-scoped database rows, each identifying a
supported CLI (`claude` or `codex`), optional launch flags, and an optional default model. A runner
SHALL NOT be represented only as an in-memory or hardcoded mapping.

#### Scenario: Runner is created

- **WHEN** an operator creates a runner naming a supported CLI
- **THEN** the Hub persists it as a project-scoped record with a stable identifier

#### Scenario: Only supported CLIs are accepted

- **WHEN** an operator attempts to create a runner naming a CLI other than `claude` or `codex`
- **THEN** the Hub rejects the request

### Requirement: Built-in runners are seeded on first use

A project with zero runner records SHALL be seeded with one default runner per supported CLI before
any agent can be bound to a runner.

#### Scenario: First boot seeds default runners

- **WHEN** a project has no runner records and the Hub starts
- **THEN** the Hub creates a default `claude` runner and a default `codex` runner for that project

### Requirement: An agent is bound to at most one runner

Each Hub `Agent` record SHALL reference at most one runner record. Triggering an agent with no
bound runner SHALL fail with a typed, actionable error rather than falling back to an undeclared
default.

#### Scenario: Agent triggers using its bound runner

- **WHEN** the Hub triggers an agent that has a bound runner
- **THEN** it spawns the CLI, flags, and model that runner record specifies

#### Scenario: Agent has no bound runner

- **WHEN** the Hub receives a trigger for an agent with no runner bound
- **THEN** it refuses the launch and returns a typed error naming the missing binding

### Requirement: Runner management is available through the Hub UI

The Hub UI SHALL provide a screen to list, create, edit, and delete runner records, and to bind an
agent to a runner from the agent's detail view.

#### Scenario: Operator creates a custom runner variant

- **WHEN** an operator creates a second `claude` runner with a different default model
- **THEN** both runners are available for binding to any agent independently

#### Scenario: Operator binds an agent to a runner

- **WHEN** an operator selects a runner for an agent in the Hub UI
- **THEN** the agent's runner binding updates and subsequent triggers use the newly bound runner
