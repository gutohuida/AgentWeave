## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Hub logs usability
The Hub Logs UI SHALL expose diagnostics in a way that reflects the current project rather than a fixed set of agents.

#### Scenario: Agent filter includes actual agents
- **WHEN** the Hub Logs view is opened
- **THEN** the agent filter includes agents from configured session data, the project's agents, or returned log entries, including custom agents and proxy agents

#### Scenario: Diagnostic category filters exist
- **WHEN** diagnostic events exist in the log stream
- **THEN** the user can filter or search common categories such as runner, proxy credentials, setup, jobs, and agent stderr

#### Scenario: Log detail remains secret-safe
- **WHEN** a log entry contains diagnostic data derived from env vars, transport config, or runner commands
- **THEN** the UI does not display secret values
