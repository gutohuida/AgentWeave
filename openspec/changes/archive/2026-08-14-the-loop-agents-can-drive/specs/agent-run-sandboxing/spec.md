## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: A refusal is recorded wherever it is decided

The system SHALL record a durable event when it refuses an agent's action, regardless of which runtime decided the refusal.

An operator reading the activity of a run needs to know an agent was blocked. A refusal that exists
only in the agent's own prose account is one the operator will not find, and the agent's summary of
its own failure is a claim rather than a record.

Recording SHALL cover refusals a runtime decides on its own, not only those the operator was asked
about. The refusals an operator never saw are precisely the ones they cannot otherwise learn of.

A refusal SHALL be recorded once. A decision the operator already answered is already recorded, and
recording it again tells them it happened twice.

Only refusals SHALL be recorded. An allowed action is the ordinary case, and an event per allowed
action buries the refusals among them.

The recorded event SHALL name the refused action in terms the operator can read.

#### Scenario: A runtime refuses an action on its own

- **WHEN** a runtime refuses an agent's action without asking the operator
- **THEN** the refusal appears in the project's activity

#### Scenario: An operator-answered refusal is recorded once

- **WHEN** the operator is asked about an action and refuses it
- **THEN** exactly one refusal is recorded

#### Scenario: Allowed actions are not recorded as refusals

- **WHEN** a runtime allows an agent's action
- **THEN** no refusal is recorded

#### Scenario: The refused action is readable

- **WHEN** a refusal is recorded
- **THEN** the action it names is readable rather than an internal method name
