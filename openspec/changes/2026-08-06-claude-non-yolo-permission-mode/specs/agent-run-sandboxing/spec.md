## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: A non-yolo Claude run's sandbox posture is set by the Hub, not the host machine

The Hub SHALL pass an explicit, non-bypass permission mode to every non-yolo Claude run it spawns. A
non-yolo Claude run's actual permission behavior MUST NOT depend on the config file of the machine the
Hub process happens to run on.

#### Scenario: Non-yolo Claude run gets an explicit permission mode

- **WHEN** the Hub spawns a Claude agent whose run is not `yolo`
- **THEN** the spawned command line includes an explicit non-bypass permission mode flag

#### Scenario: Yolo Claude run is unaffected

- **WHEN** the Hub spawns a Claude agent whose run is `yolo`
- **THEN** the spawned command line includes `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
- **AND** does not include the non-yolo permission mode flag

### Requirement: A sandboxed non-yolo Claude agent can still use the Hub's own MCP tools

When a non-yolo Claude run has the Hub's own MCP server configured, the Hub SHALL allowlist that
server's tools explicitly, so the agent's general sandbox does not also block AgentWeave's own tooling.

#### Scenario: Hub's own MCP tools remain usable under the sandbox

- **WHEN** the Hub spawns a non-yolo Claude agent with its own MCP server configured
- **THEN** the spawned command line allowlists that server's tools
- **AND** an action outside that allowlist is still refused

#### Scenario: No allowlist is added when there is nothing to allowlist

- **WHEN** the Hub spawns a non-yolo Claude agent with no MCP server configured
- **THEN** the spawned command line does not include an MCP tool allowlist flag
