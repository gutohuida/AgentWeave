## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: A runner's flags may select a transport, and unset means the safe default

A runner's flags MAY carry sentinel values that select how the Hub starts a run rather than
arguments passed to the runner's CLI. A sentinel SHALL NOT be forwarded to the CLI as an argument.

A runner whose flags are unset SHALL receive the Hub's default transport for its CLI, and that
default SHALL be the one whose tool surface the agent can actually call. Selecting a degraded
transport SHALL require an explicit sentinel.

#### Scenario: An unconfigured runner gets the working default

- **WHEN** a runner is created with no flags
- **THEN** runs it backs use the Hub's default transport for that CLI

#### Scenario: A transport sentinel never reaches the CLI

- **WHEN** a runner's flags contain a transport sentinel
- **THEN** the command the Hub builds does not contain that sentinel as an argument

#### Scenario: Opting out is explicit

- **WHEN** a runner's flags contain the opt-out sentinel for its CLI's default transport
- **THEN** runs it backs use the alternative transport
